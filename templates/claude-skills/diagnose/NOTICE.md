## Modifications from upstream

The body has been rewritten as a procedural mechanism. Persona,
exhortation, and rhetorical emphasis are stripped; phases, criteria, and
ordering are preserved. The diagnostic intent is faithful.

Specific changes:

- Added `invocation: reflex` and a `triggers:` block per
  `~/.praxis/skill-invocation-policy.md`. Praxis-ai treats diagnose as a
  reflex skill that auto-fires on an objective signal (two consecutive
  command failures in F2 execution) in addition to the upstream's
  user-utterance triggers.
- Rationale: praxis-ai's F2 execution phase already tracks consecutive
  failures (see `phase-flow.md` retry cap). Auto-invoking diagnose at the
  second failure routes the agent into a disciplined loop before the
  third failure forces a backward transition to F1.
- The upstream's optional `scripts/hitl-loop.template.sh` reference is
  preserved as a procedural mention (last-resort HITL bash script) but
  the file is not bundled. The praxis overlay does not ship the script.
